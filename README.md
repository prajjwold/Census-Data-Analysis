# Census-Data-Analysis
The main theme of this project is the implementation of the distributed computing for the large datasets. The project focused on the analysis of sample census data which is provided by Census Bureau of Statistic (CBS), Nepal. Using Hadoop, an open source framework for distributed computing, the raw data of the census are processed and analyzed. With this project, we demonstrate how the use of distributed computing benefits the efficiency and cost effectiveness in analysis of large datasets.

This Project use Big Data Technologies; Hadoop and HBase for the backend data processing and algorithms and use Groovy and Grails for the the frontend.
